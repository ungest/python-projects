# Coffee Maker Program

This Coffee Maker program is an interactive command-line application that simulates a coffee vending machine. It allows users to choose from three types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The program manages resources, processes transactions, and delivers coffee based on user inputs.

## Features

- **Coffee Selection**: Users can choose between espresso, latte, or cappuccino.
- **Resource Management**: The program checks if sufficient resources (water, milk, coffee) are available before making a drink.
- **Financial Transactions**: Users insert coins into the machine, and the program calculates the total and checks if the amount is sufficient for the selected drink.
- **Reporting**: Users can request a report showing the current resource levels and money collected.
- **Shutdown Capability**: Maintainers can shut down the machine by entering 'off'.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Program**: Run the script to start the coffee machine program.
2. **Select a Drink**: Input your choice of drink (espresso, latte, cappuccino).
3. **Insert Coins**: Follow the prompts to insert quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
4. **Enjoy Your Coffee**: If the transaction is successful and resources are sufficient, the machine will dispense your selected coffee.
